/*
 * This module implements program loading.  The program text (code) and
 * initialized data are first read from the program executable.  Next, the
 * program uninitialized data segment is initialized to all zero's.  Finally,
 * the program stack is initialized with command line arguments and
 * environment variables.  The format of the top of stack when the program
 * starts execution is as follows:
 *
 * 0x7fffffff    +----------+
 *               | unused   |
 * 0x7fffc000    +----------+
 *               | envp     |
 *               | strings  |
 *               +----------+
 *               | argv     |
 *               | strings  |
 *               +----------+
 *               | envp     |
 *               | array    |
 *               +----------+
 *               | argv     |
 *               | array    |
 *               +----------+
 *               | argc     |
 * regs_R[29]    +----------+
 * (stack ptr)
 *
 * NOTE: the start of envp is computed in crt0.o (C startup code) using the
 * value of argc and the computed size of the argv array, the envp array size
 * is not specified, but rather it is NULL terminated, so the startup code
 * has to scan memory for the end of the string.
