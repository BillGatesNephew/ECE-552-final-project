OVERVIEW:

This README file is for the SimpleScalar simulator release 2.0.  This release
is available from:

	http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~mscalar/simplescalar.html

in the file simplesim-2.0.tar.gz.


TO INSTALL:

The following details how to build and install the SimpleScalar simulators:

	a) vi Makefile

	make sure all compile options are set for your host, you'll likely
	not have to change anything for the supported hosts, and if you need
	to change anything, it will likely be the CC variable (which specifies
	the ANSI C compiler to use to build the simulators).  NOTE: the
	simulators must be built with an ANSI-C compatible compiler, if you
	have problems with your compiler, try using GNU GCC as it is known
	to build the simulators on all the supported platforms.

	b) make

	this builds the simplescalar simulators

	c) make sim-tests

	this tests the simulators, this step will take anywhere from ~5 min
	to an hour, depending on the performance of your host.  Inspect the
	output of this command, when the script diff's the outputs of the
	simulators against the known good outputs, there should be no
	differences

	d) vi pipeview.pl textprof.pl

	configure these two perl scripts by placing the location of your
	perl executable on the first line of each script


TO INSTALL THE BINUTILS:

There are many tools in the binary utilities distribution that you may find
useful (e.g., objdump, size, nm, etc...).  The binary utilities can be found
in the distribution file simpleutils-2.0.tar.gz (at the location listed above).

To build and install the SimpleScalar-enabled binary utilities, unpack the
sources in the same directory you unpacked the simulator distribution (i.e.,
the directory with directory "simplesim-2.0/" in it):

Step 1: determine the endian of your host

	a) cd simplesim-2.0
	b) make sysprobe
	c) sysprobe -s

	the last command should return either "big" or "little" indicating
	that your host is big- or little-endian, respectively

Step 2: build and install the SimpleScalar-enabled binary utilities

	a) cd ../binutils-2.5.2
	b) sh ./config.guess

	this command will tell you your host type, let's call this <host>

	c) configure --host=<host> --target=ss<endian>-na-sstrix --with-gnu-as --with-gnu-ld --prefix=<dir>

	this configures the binary utilities package for your host, replace
	<host> with the string returned from command 2.b, replace <endian>
	with "big" or "little", as specified by the command 1.c above, and
	replace <dir> with the directory you would like to contain the binary
	utilities "bin/", "lib/", and "man/" subdirectory, this is probably
	the directory containing "binutils-2.5.2" and "simplesim-2.0"

	d) make

	this builds the binary utilities

	e) make install

	this installs the binary utilities into <dir>

	NOTE: if you previously installed the binary utilities package for
	another host, be sure and do a "make distclean" before rebuilding
	the package, or strange errors may occur.


FOR MORE INFORMATION:

For general documentation on the tool set, see the hacker's guide in the file
"hack_guide.{pfd,ps,ppt}".  Frequently asked questions are answered in the FAQ
file.  And suggested projects are listed in the file PROJECTS.  The simulators
(the sim-* executables) are self-documenting, just run them with the "-h" flag.
