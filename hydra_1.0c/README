This README file is for HydraScalar v1.0, whose files appear in this
directory.  It is derived from SimpleScalar (SS) 2.0e, and many of its
supporting files have been used almost unchanged.  The SimpleScalar
README, installation instructions, copyright, and other documentation
appear in the ss_docs/ subdirectory.  The SimpleScalar copy
restrictions (ss_docs/COPYING) apply to files which are substantially
unchanged; the HydraScalar copy restrictions (COPYING) apply only to
'bconf.c', 'bpred.c', and 'hydra.c'.

To install HydraScalar, you will need GNU's gcc compiler, and will
also have to obtain a copy of the SimpleScalar "binutils".  See
ss_docs/README.  I suggest you install the binutils in a directory at
the same level as the HydraScalar directory.  Then the Makefile should
work as is.  Otherwise, you will need to edit the line
	BINUTILS_DIR = ../$(PLATFORM)/
in the Makefile.  You may also have to change the MAKE variable.

Once the binutils have been installed, compile HydraScalar by
saying:
	make PLATFORM=target EXTRA_CFLAGS="-DSS_ENDIAN"
where "target" is the binutils directory you just made (eg sun),
and "ENDIAN" is either "BIG" or "LITTLE" according to your target
platform.  You can also add other compiler flags to the EXTRA_CFLAGS
section.  So for a Sun, to compile with -DDEBUG, you would get:
	make PLATFORM=sun EXTRA_CFLAGS="-DSS_BIG -DDEBUG"

Two sample configuration files have been provided in the config/ 
directory:
	limits.cfg - an idealized configuration for exploring
                     limits of performance
	real.cfg - a realistic near-term configuration
