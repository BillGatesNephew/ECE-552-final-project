The Alpha/OSF port is new in release 2.0.  Currently, it is still under test.
In addition, the GNU compiler tool chain (except libbfd.a) have not yet
been ported.  So to use the test port, you'll need little-endian program
binaries from the binaries release, or you can build them on any another
supported little-endian platform.

Please send us any bugs/fixes that you find if you use this port.
